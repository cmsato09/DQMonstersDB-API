## Intro
Dragon Quest Monsters is a spin-off series based on the famous JRPG series, 
Dragon Quest. This database informs the user of game details (monsters, skills, 
items, etc.) of [Dragon Quest Monsters -- Terry's Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters)
(also known as Dragon Warrior Monsters in the US). 

Released in Japan in 1998 for the Gameboy Color by Enix, it was compared to the 
Pokemon series due to their similar gameplay of taming and training monsters 
to battle other monsters via random encounters. However, gameplay differs with
its roguelike dungeon levels, the battle play, and the breeding system. 

The game is quite old and not many copies are in circulation. The current way 
to play the game is to buy "Dragon Quest Monsters -- Terry's Wonderland RETRO"
for the Nintendo Switch on the Japanese Nintendo eShop or on Google Play and 
Apple Store by setting your region to Japan (the game will be in Japanese). 
Otherwise, use an emulator and download the English version.

## Project Description

This project's purpose is to learn basic web programming with Python by 
creating my own wiki website and database. There are some Japanese game wikis 
for this particular game, but incredibly frustrating to use and search through. 
By putting all the data into a SQL database, it should be easier to access and
find information.
